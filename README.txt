CONTEXT FOR THIS WEBSITE:

This website is made by oSTEM (out in STEM, not ohSTEM as the same suggests) at NYU.
A growing concern among students in our University who attend our oSTEM events is being "found out".
Essentially, their concern is that family members who might not be entirely OK with this attendance (i.e. Homophobia)
might discover what their child/niece/nephew/etc. has been a part of these oSTEM at NYU events.
This can lead to many complications/problems such as the student being forcibly "outed", being a target for bullying/abuse,
and a possible forced academic resignation. With all these problems presented to us, we wanted to create a fake oSTEM website
(ohSTEM) that students can show to their family members. A website that stays true to the professional side of oSTEM, but hides
the LGBTQ+ side.

This is NOT in any way a hateful attempt to devalue the work that oSTEM does, or to villify the organization.
We are doing this AS PART OF oSTEM at NYU in an attempt to protect the identities of all students who attend our events.
We are doing this to ensure the safety of our students and the general safety of the LGBTQ+ Community present at New York University.

Thank you for reading!
